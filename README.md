This project makes use of the NAUDIO COM bindings to WASAPI and the MMDeviceAPI, meaning that the only supported platform is Windows.<br>
The sine signal generator can make signals of varying frequency, sample frequency and bit depth representing each sample<br>
Audio with varying bit depths can be generated and played, specifically bit depths that are a multiple of 8, but less than 64<br>

By default, a sample rate of 44.1kHz and a bit depth of 8 is used.
